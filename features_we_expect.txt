Goal: Simplify full data transfer from postgresql to MongoDB.

# namings in quotes are just for now, we probably will change them. Having this type of naming makes things easier in CLI which we want to use to do things quickly

1) "basic copy" - copy all data that is present in postgres database tables and directly copy it into mongodb

2) "Auto import" - copy data from PG tables, but this time make schema changes like nesting all 1 to many relationship data into some side(which? - configurable or automatic decision/static ?) and similar optimisations to make quering easier and faster in mongodb

3) "Advanced" - define how you want to reshape data when doing import - map specific postgres field types to specific mongodb BSON types, automatic conversion of primary keys into _id fields(configurable?), using references vs nesting 1-to many values into arrays e.t.c - (this step probably should be done with some basic scripts that our software will generate for user?)


# later todos
. support replicated/sharded clusters
